## An icon taskbar for the GNOME Shell
An icon taskbar for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers and system tray are combined into a single panel, similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.

The easiest way to install Dash-to-Panel is from [Gnome Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/).

This extension manipulates the Gnome Main Panel, aka Top Bar. So, most other extensions which operate on the top bar should be compatible.

## FAQ

How do I embed my bottom left notification drawer into the panel like a system tray? [Top Icons Plus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons)

How do I add a traditional start menu? [Gno-Menu](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/608/gnomenu/)

How do I disable the hot corner? [No Topleft Hot Corner](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/118/no-topleft-hot-corner)

How do I move the notifications to somewhere other than the top center? [Panel OSD](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd)

How do I add transparency to the panel? [Dynamic Panel Transparency](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1011/dynamic-panel-transparency/)

How do I change workspaces by scrolling the mouse wheel in the empty space? [Top Panel Workspace Scroll](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/701/top-panel-workspace-scroll/)

How do I display Minimize & Maximize buttons? In the Tweak Tool application, turn on `Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize`.

Why can't I put the panel vertically on the left or right of the display? Gnome-shell and it's numerous extensions add widgets to the panel. These widgets have been designed using padding and absolute positioning assuming a horizontal layout. At this point in time, I don't think it is possible to allow for a vertical layout and still maintain any sort of reasonable compatibility with many of the other features of Gnome.
